and promises.

#### useCache() [`@react-hook/cache`](packages/cache)

A React hook for accessing an asynchronous key/value cache that persists data between renders and
components. This allows you to do neat stuff like preload data before your next
page or component has even started mounting.

#### useClick() [`@react-hook/click`](packages/click)

A React hook for conditionally firing a function when an element is
clicked - for instance if you only want a click even to fire on
double-clicks.

#### useDebounce() [`@react-hook/debounce`](packages/debounce)

A React hook for debouncing setState and other callbacks.

#### useEvent() [`@react-hook/event`](packages/event)

A React hook for adding events to HTML elements. This hook cleans up your listeners
automatically when it unmounts. You won't have to worry about wrapping your

is always invoked.

A React hook for adding Google Optimize variants to components.

#### useHotkey() [`@react-hook/hotkey`](packages/hotkey)

A React hook for invoking a callback when hotkeys are pressed. This hook also

the library turns it into an `event.which` key code if it has to.

#### useHover() [`@react-hook/hover`](packages/hover)

A React hook for tracking the hover state of DOM elements in browsers
where hover is enabled. If the browser does not support hover states
(e.g. a phone) the `isHovering` value will always be `false`.
